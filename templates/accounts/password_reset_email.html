Hi there, Someone asked for a password reset for the email address {{ email }},
Follow the link below: 
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %} 
in case you forgot your
Django Boards username: {{ user.username }} if clicking the link above doesnt
work, please copy and paste the URL in a new broswer instead. if you've received
this email in error, its likely that another user entered your email address by
mistake while trying to reset a password. if you didnt initiate the request, you
dont need to take any further action and can safely disregard this email.
thanks. the django boards team
